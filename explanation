explanation:
The maze_game.cpp code is a simple maze game that runs in the console.
It uses the characters # (hash), P (player), and G (goal) to create a maze layout.
The player starts at position (1, 1) marked by 'P', and they need to reach the goal 'G' at position (8, 8).
The maze contains walls represented by #, and the player can't move through them.
The player can use the arrow keys ('w' for up, 's' for down, 'a' for left, 'd' for right) to move 'P' through the maze.
The console will update the maze display in real-time after each move.
The game continues until the player reaches the goal 'G'.
Once the player reaches the goal, the game displays a congratulatory message.
In summary, the maze game lets you control the 'P' character in a 2D maze, and you need to find your way to the goal 'G' while avoiding the walls ('#').
Use the arrow keys to move, and when you reach 'G', the game will celebrate your success!
