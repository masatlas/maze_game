Maze Game - README

Instructions:
1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system.
2. Open a text editor and copy the C++ code from `maze_game.cpp`.
3. Save the file with the extension `.cpp`, for example, `maze_game.cpp`.
4. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved `maze_game.cpp`.
5. Compile the code using your C++ compiler. For example, if you are using g++, you can compile it with the following command:
   g++ maze_game.cpp -o maze_game
6. Once the compilation is successful, you will have an executable file (maze_game.exe on Windows or maze_game on Linux/macOS).
7. Run the game by typing the name of the executable and pressing Enter.
8. The maze will be displayed, and you will control the player ('P') with the arrow keys.
9. Navigate through the maze and try to reach the goal ('G') without hitting the walls ('#').
10. Press 'w' to move up, 's' to move down, 'a' to move left, and 'd' to move right.
11. Continue moving until you reach the goal. Congratulations if you succeed!

Enjoy the game!
